* [Chat](https://github.com/rawnney/PearGameChat)
* [API](https://github.com/robinwiss/PearGameAPI)


Our game is set up on three different heroku instances, one for the API, one for the game chatt and one for the actual game-client. Pushing new content to master branch on github will rebuild the application live on Heroku.
